<!-- To do:  Incorporate binomial distribution calculator (incl. for "less" and "more" as well as "equal").  This substitutes for the z-table or what it's called, the probability density function or whatever.
From this information, meaningful odds can be imparted.  Look into "jaggedness"; the interval count has got to be translatable into risk mechanics somehow.  Or is it already, but I don't know the terminology, or if I know the terminology, do I not know it applies?
For example, n-1 vs n, etc.  Normal approximation to the mean, combined with binomial lookup; equations and tables used to extrapolate uncalculated positions that require lots of computation-->
